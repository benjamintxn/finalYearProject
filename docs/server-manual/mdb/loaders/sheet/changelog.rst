ChangeLog Sheet
===============

This optional sheet contains the list revisions made to the described space system.

The sheet should have these columns:

``version`` (required)
    Version number of this spreadsheet. Defined by the author. Entries in the changelog should have increasing version numbers.

``date`` (required)
    When the change was made. This should be a date field, however any string value is accepted.

``message``
    Free-text description of the change.

``author``
    Author of the change.

Unlike with other sheets, the column names are not currently enforced. Instead the column order must match this description.
