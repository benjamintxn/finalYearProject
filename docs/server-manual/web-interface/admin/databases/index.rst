Databases
=========

This page lists all the Yamcs databases. There is at least one database named ``_global`` for Yamcs housekeeping, and then one database for each Yamcs instance. Databases have the same name as the instance.

By selecting a database, we can see a listing of its tables and streams, or execute manual queries in a SQL-like language.
