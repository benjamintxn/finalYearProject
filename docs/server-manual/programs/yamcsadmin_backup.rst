Description
-----------

Use :program:`yamcsadmin backup` when you want to save and restore Yamcs data.

Backups are performed at the level of a tablespace, which (unless otherwise configured) corresponds with an instance name. A special tablespace ``_global`` contains data that is not specific to an instance.

The backup directory is in binary format and can contain multiple restore points, one for each time the ``create`` command was used. Use the ``list`` command to see all restore points in a backup directory.


Commands
--------

.. describe:: create --backup-dir <DIR> [--data-dir <DIR>] [--pid <PID>] [--url <HOST:PORT>] <TABLESPACE>

    Create a backup of a Yamcs tablespace. The default mode of this command is to find a locally running Yamcs server and attach to its JVM for submitting a backup instruction while Yamcs is running.

    If (and only if) Yamcs is stopped, you can perform a cold backup using the :option:`--data-dir` property.

.. describe:: delete --backup-dir <DIR> <ID>...

    Delete one or more backups.

.. describe:: list --backup-dir <DIR>

    List the existing backups.

.. describe:: purge --backup-dir <DIR> --keep <N>

    Purge old backups.

.. describe:: restore --backup-dir <DIR> --restore-dir <DIR> [<ID>]

    Restore a backup by its ID.

    If unspecified ``<ID>`` defaults to the last backup.

    Note that backups can only be restored when Yamcs is not running.


Options
-------

.. option:: --backup-dir <DIR>

    Directory containing backups.

    When used with the ``create`` command, the directory is automatically created if it does not yet exist.

.. option:: --data-dir <DIR>

    This option is only valid for the ``create`` command.

    Path to a Yamcs data directory. This must be specified when performing a cold backup.

.. option:: --restore-dir <DIR>

    This option is only valid for the ``restore`` command.

    Directory where to restore the backup.

.. option:: --pid <PID>

    This option is only valid for the ``create`` command.

    Specify the program identifier of the Yamcs server to attach to. If there is only one server running, use of this option is unnecessary.

.. option:: --host <HOST:PORT>

    This option is only valid for the ``create`` command.

    Perform a hot backup using a remote JMX operation.

.. option:: --keep <N>

    This option is only valid for the ``purge`` command.

    The number of backups to keep.

.. option:: <ID>

   A unique identifier for a restore point. You can find existing identifiers using the ``list`` command.
